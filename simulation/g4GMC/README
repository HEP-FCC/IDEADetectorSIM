g4GMC is the MonteCarlo software developed using the Geant4 libraries to simulate the
Gas Monitored chamber.

Before to install the code:
    -- load the enviroment variables  
    -- check if the GMCAnalyzer is installed: g4GMC requires libGMCAnalyzer.so

then type the command:
    gmake
    
If the compiling step is successfully done two file.exe are generated in ./bin/Linux++/ 
directory:

     1) g4GMC.exe       --> Montecarlo tool for simulation
     2) readHits.exe    --> Converts the hits.root file in a suitable format for GMCAnalyzer
     
======================
g4GMC.exe

To run simulation step typing the command

    ./bin/Linux++/g4GMC run1.mac

The macro run1.mac drives the simulation tool: by this is possible to change the starting seeds
    /random/setSeeds     xxxxxxx   yyyyyyy

the tracking and hits verbose level
    /tracking/verbose
    /hits/verbose
 
and the number of generated events (default 1000 events)
    /run/beamOn 1000 

Isn't possible to change the particle type (e-), the paricle momentum (500MeV) and the generated 
number particles for each event (1 particle); while the generation parameters, vertex and direction,
are gaussian distribuited in according to BTF beam characteristics. 

The simulation tool uses a geometry configuration file too: configGeomFile.txt
In this file is possible to set the pixel position with respect to the chamber wall, and the
chamber rotation angle with respect to beam direction (axis z). The chamber is assumed to be
in the reference center.

Is possible to export the geometry as .gdml format switch on the related flag in configGeomFile.txt

The output file is hits.root.

======================
readHits.exe

This application converts the file hits.root generated by g4GMC in the MCData00001.root file
used as input in GMCAnalyzer.
To use it type the command

    ./bin/Linux++/readHits hits.root


======================
The script Script.sh

A shell script example to simulate independent run of events is provided.
Typing  the command:

    ./Script.sh $n

the script generate in automatic way 'n' seeds, set its into a new macro.mac
and call the g4GMC application.
The output file hits.root is automatically converted in right format and
stored in the directory 
    ../SimData
