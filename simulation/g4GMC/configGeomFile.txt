#           configuration file for the detector construction
#
# Is possible to set only the position of the external tracker 
# (modupix detector) with respect to drift chamber which is put in the 
# Reference frame origin
#
# all positions are in cm
#
# zpos is the distance between the drift chamber box and pixel detector: 
#
# Pixel number 1 (in front of the beam)
A_pos 0. 0. -30.
# 
# Pixel number 2 (after the drift chamber) 
# now, a simmetric configuration is choosen
B_pos 0. 0. 30.
#
# Chamber rotation angle with respect beam direction (deg) 
# (default = 0. the chamber is perpendicular to the beam direction
R_angle 0. 0. 45.
#
#
# Chamber shift with respect to the reference frame origin
Shift 0. 0. 0.
