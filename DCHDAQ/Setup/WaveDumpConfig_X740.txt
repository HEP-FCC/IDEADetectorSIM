# OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT: output file can be either ASCII (column of decimal numbers) or binary 
# (2 bytes per sample)
# options: BINARY, ASCII
OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT  ASCII

# OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER: if enabled, the header is included in the output file data
# options: YES, NO
OUTPUT_FILE_HEADER  NO

# RECORD_LENGTH = number of samples in the acquisition window
RECORD_LENGTH  1024

# TEST_PATTERN: if enabled, data from ADC are replaced by test pattern (triangular wave)
# options: YES, NO
TEST_PATTERN   NO

# EXTERNAL_TRIGGER: external trigger input settings. When enabled, the ext. trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   DISABLED	

# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. Higher values may lead
# to higher readout bandwidth, requiring more memory allocation for the block transfer.
# options: 1 to 1023
MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT   1

#PULSE_POLARITY: input signal polarity.
#options: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE
#
PULSE_POLARITY  POSITIVE

# DECIMATION_FACTOR: change the decimation factor for the acquisition.
# options: 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128  
DECIMATION_FACTOR  1

# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100 
POST_TRIGGER  50

# USE_INTERRUPT: number of events that must be ready for the readout when the IRQ is asserted.
# Zero means that the interrupts are not used (readout runs continuously)
# values: 0 to 1023
USE_INTERRUPT 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM

# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access
# to the registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed AFTER the other settings,
# thus it might happen that the direct write overwrites a specific setting.
# To avoid this use the right "MASK".
# Syntax: WRITE_REGISTER ADDRESS DATA MASK, where ADDRESS is the address offset of the register (16 bit hex), DATA
# is the value being written (32 bit hex) and MASK is the bitmask to be used for DATA masking.
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 1, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0100 0100
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 0, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0000 0100
# Example: Set register 1080 to the value of 0x45:
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 45 FFFFFFFF


# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Individual Settings 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following setting are usually applied on channel by channel
# basis; however, you can put them also in the [COMMON] section in
# order to apply them to all the channels.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# ENABLE_INPUT: enable/disable one group of channels
# options: YES, NO
ENABLE_INPUT          YES


#BASELINE_SHIFT: baseline position in percent of the Full Scale. 
# The baseline shift is the same for all channels in the group
# POSITIVE PULSE POLARITY (Full Scale = from 0 to + Vpp)
# 0: analog input dynamic range = from 0 to +Vpp 
# 50: analog input dynamic range = from +Vpp/2 to +Vpp 
# 100: analog input dynamic range = null (usually not used)*
# NEGATIVE PULSE POLARITY (Full Scale = from -Vpp to 0) 
# 0: analog input dynamic range = from -Vpp to 0 
# 50: analog input dynamic range = from -Vpp/2 to 0 
# 100: analog input dynamic range = null (usually not used)*
#
# options: 0 to 100
BASELINE_SHIFT  50


# DC_OFFSET: DC offset adjust (DAC channel setting) in percent of the Full Scale. 
# the DC offset adjust is the same for all channels in the group 
# -50: analog input dynamic range = -Vpp to 0 (negative signals)*
# +50: analog input dynamic range = 0 to +Vpp (positive signals)*
# 0:   analog input dynamic range = -Vpp/2 to +Vpp/2 (bipolar signals)*
#options: -50 to 50
#DC_OFFSET              0 


# TRIGGER_THRESHOLD: threshold for the channel auto trigger (ADC counts)
# options 0 to 2^N-1 (N=Number of bit of the ADC)
# *if DC_OFFSET is used the threshold is absolute* 
# *if BASELINE_SHIFT is used the threshold is relative to the baseline of the first channel in the group*:
# POSITIVE PULSE POLARITY: threshold = baseline + TRIGGER_THRESHOLD
# NEGATIVE PULSE POLARITY: threshold = baseline - TRIGGER_THRESHOLD
#
#TRIGGER_THRESHOLD      100

# CHANNEL_TRIGGER: channel auto trigger settings. When enabled, the ch. auto trg. can be either 
# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT, TRGOUT_ONLY
CHANNEL_TRIGGER        ACQUISITION_ONLY

# GROUP_TRG_ENABLE_MASK: channels are grouped 8 by 8; one group of 8 channels has a common trigger that is generated as
# the OR of the self trigger of the channels in the group that are enabled by this mask.
# options: 0 to FF
