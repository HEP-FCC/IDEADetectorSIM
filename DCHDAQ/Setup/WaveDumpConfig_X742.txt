# TEST_PATTERN: if enabled, data from ADC are replaced by test pattern (triangular wave)
# options: YES, NO
TEST_PATTERN   NO

# propagated (ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT) or not (ACQUISITION_ONLY) through the TRGOUT
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY, ACQUISITION_AND_TRGOUT
EXTERNAL_TRIGGER   DISABLED

# FAST_TRIGGER: fast trigger input settings. ONLY FOR 742 MODELS. When enabled, the fast trigger is used
# for the data acquisition 
# options: DISABLED, ACQUISITION_ONLY
FAST_TRIGGER   ACQUISITION_ONLY		

# FAST_TRIGGER_DIGITIZING: ONLY FOR 742 MODELS. If enabled the fast trigger signal is digitized and it is
# present in data readout as channel n.8 for each group.
# options: YES, NO
ENABLED_FAST_TRIGGER_DIGITIZING		YES		

# MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT: maximum number of events to read out in one Block Transfer. Higher values may lead
# to higher readout bandwidth, requiring more memory allocation for the block transfer.
# options: 1 to 1023
MAX_NUM_EVENTS_BLT   1

#PULSE_POLARITY: input signal polarity.
#options: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE
#
PULSE_POLARITY  NEGATIVE

# POST_TRIGGER: post trigger size in percent of the whole acquisition window
# options: 0 to 100
# For x742 there is a delay of about 42 nsec on Fast Trigger TR, and about 115 nsec on TRG-IN; 
# the post trigger is added to this delay  
POST_TRIGGER  50

# USE_INTERRUPT: number of events that must be ready for the readout when the IRQ is asserted.
# Zero means that the interrupts are not used (readout runs continuously)
# values: 0 to 1023
USE_INTERRUPT 0

# FPIO_LEVEL: type of the front panel I/O LEMO connectors 
# options: NIM, TTL
FPIO_LEVEL  NIM

# WRITE_REGISTER: generic write register access. This command allows the user to have a direct write access
# to the registers of the board. NOTE: all the direct write accesses are executed AFTER the other settings,
# thus it might happen that the direct write overwrites a specific setting.
# To avoid this use the right "MASK".
# Syntax: WRITE_REGISTER ADDRESS DATA MASK, where ADDRESS is the address offset of the register (16 bit hex), DATA
# is the value being written (32 bit hex) and MASK is the bitmask to be used for DATA masking.
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 1, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0100 0100
# Example: Set only bit [8] of register 1080 to 0, leaving the other bits to their previous value
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 0000 0100
# Example: Set register 1080 to the value of 0x45:
# WRITE_REGISTER 1080 45 FFFFFFFF

# This parameter allows to skip ADC calibration performed at startup.
# NOTE: this parameter makes sense only for digitizers which support calibration.
# Allowed values: YES/NO
SKIP_STARTUP_CALIBRATION NO
